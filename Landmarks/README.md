# Landmarks App

This is built following a SwiftUI essentials tutorial project from [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui). It is a simple app that shows a list of landmarks and a detail view for each landmark. The project builds on to show how to use SwiftUI and UIKit to build a multi-platform app (iOS, watchOS, macOS).
